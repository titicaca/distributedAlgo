\section{Mutual Exclusion}

\section{Distributed Garbage Collection}
\begin{itemize}
\item JAVA RMI: RMI uses a fairly straightforward mechanism for garbage collection, which is explained in detail in [1]. Any program which has a reference to an object must obtain a "lease" for the object.The lease, which is literally represented by a Lease object, entitles the program to use the object for a certain period of time.

\item Microsoft DCOM: DCOM differentiates between interfaces and objects. Each has its own type of garbage collection support.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Interfaces: Garbage collection of interfaces is handled through a manual reference counting mechanism. RemAddRef and RemRelease respectively add and release references to remote objects. To reduce the overhead by "multiplexing references", a single reference can actually stand for many references within a single program.
    \item Objects: Garbage collection of Objects send keepalive messages periodically to objects as a way of pinging the objects to let them know they are still needed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
